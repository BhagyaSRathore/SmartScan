# SmartScan
SmartScan is a Python-based document scanner that uses OpenCV and Tkinter to detect, crop, and enhance documents from webcam or images. It applies perspective correction and adaptive thresholding to produce clear, scan-like outputs, helping digitize notes, bills, and papers easily.
SmartScan is a Python-based desktop application that transforms your computer into a lightweight document scanner. Using computer vision techniques (OpenCV) and a simple graphical interface (Tkinter), it allows users to scan documents through a webcam or by uploading images, and then processes them to produce clean, high-quality scans.

The system works in the following steps:

Document Detection – SmartScan automatically detects the edges of a paper/document within an image or live camera feed using contour detection.

Perspective Correction – Even if the document is captured at an angle, the app applies a 4-point perspective transformation to “flatten” the document as if it was scanned from above.

Image Enhancement – The scanned image is further processed with adaptive thresholding to improve clarity, contrast, and readability, resembling the quality of a traditional scanner.

User Interaction – Through its GUI, users can preview both the original and processed (scanned) image side by side, and save the final scan with a timestamp for easy organization.

🌍 Real-World Problem Solving

In today’s world, not everyone has access to a physical scanner, but almost everyone has access to a computer with a camera. SmartScan bridges this gap by providing a free, open-source alternative to mobile scanning apps or costly scanners.

Here’s how it helps in real scenarios:

🏫 For Students – Can quickly digitize handwritten notes, assignments, or study material without needing a scanner.

🧾 For Professionals – Useful for scanning receipts, bills, contracts, or signed documents for digital record-keeping.

📚 For Libraries & Researchers – Makes archiving physical documents easier by converting them into digital format.

💼 For Remote Work – Enables employees or freelancers to submit clean digital copies of paperwork without needing special equipment.

🌱 Eco-Friendly – Encourages digital storage of documents, reducing the need for photocopies and paper waste.

In short, SmartScan solves the everyday problem of digitizing documents efficiently, affordably, and accessibly. It brings the power of computer vision to a simple and practical use case, making document management easier for students, professionals, and anyone in need of quick scans.
